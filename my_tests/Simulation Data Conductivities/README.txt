In this data repository entry, the sample simulation input, output and post-processing files used for the results indicated as "Delft" in the publication titled "Computation of Electrical Conductivities of Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions: Two Surfaces, One Property" can be found. The transport properties are computed using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations . The "KCl sample" and "NaCl sample" folders hold example input and output files at 2 mol of salt per kg of water. For additional clearity, please look into origional publication (see: Blazques, S. J. Chem. Theory Comput. DOI: 10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00562).

The MD simulations are carried out using the LAMMPS (version: 16 Mar 2018) software (see: Plimpton, S. J. Comput. Phys. 1995, 117, 1â€“ 19,  DOI: 10.1006/jcph.1995.1039), using the OCTP plugin (see Jamali, S. H. J. Chem. Inc. Model. 2019, 59, 4 1290-1294, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00939).
